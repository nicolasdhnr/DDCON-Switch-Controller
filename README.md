# DMD-Nintendo-Switch-Gaming
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a neuromuscular disease which causes progressive muscle fibre degeneration and weakness. This weakness progressively advances to the extent that people affected cannot carry out daily activities and are eventually wheelchair-bound. With limited range of movement, gaming has become an important source of entertainment. However, their capability to utilise conventional gaming controllers decreases and the gaming experience becomes more painful as the disease progresses to later stages. The project was aimed to design and manufacture a comfortable, efficient and affordable gaming device for DMD patients with a focus on the late stage (late teens to 20s).
Through interviews with Duchenne United Gaming, Duchenne Family Support Group and the NHS we gained valuable feedback and alongside additional research, a Product Specification Document containing the design requirements was constructed. 
A full controller setup was manufactured including a combination of 3D printing and off the shelf products where applicable. A separate model demonstrated working code and electrical components and was combined with the manufactured setup to produce the final controller. Using 3 Arduinos and Wi-Fi modules, we produced a working prototype based on our specifications that completely emulates a Nintendo Switch Joycon (The controller for Nintendo Switch), in addition to a wrist rest in line with our user reqwuirements.
