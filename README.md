## What is DMD?

* Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a neuromuscular disease which causes progressive muscle fibre degeneration and weakness. 
* This weakness progressively advances to the extent that people affected cannot carry out daily activities and are eventually wheelchair-bound. With limited range of movement, gaming has become an important source of entertainment. However, their capability to utilise conventional gaming controllers decreases and the gaming experience becomes more painful as the disease progresses to later stages. 

* The project was aimed to design and manufacture a comfortable, efficient and affordable gaming device for DMD patients with a focus on the late stage (late teens to 20s).
